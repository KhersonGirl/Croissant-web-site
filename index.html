        A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listeni)) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
        of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants are
        named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
        succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
        texture, similar to a puff pastry. Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold
        in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough

        Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian cuisine, and are often found in French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern
        croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
        yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked
        dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
        Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food</p>
